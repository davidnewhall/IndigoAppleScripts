# IndigoAppleScripts
This folder contains AppleScripts for use with Indigo.app - Home Automation Software

#### Send_SecuritySpy_Image.applescript
This script will send a picture, via iMessage using Messages.app, from a 
defined camera in SecuritySpy. I originally wrote it for John Steenhuis to 
send a picture for a "doorbell ringing" action.

#### Send_iMessage.applescript
This script will send a text message, via iMessage using Messages.app. I use
this to send myelf messages when doors/windows open and close. I also use it
for my doorbell and to tell me when my dehumidifer needs its bucket emptied.

#### Restart_Messages.applescript
I've run into issues where Messages.app becomes unresponsive because of an
error window. I created a schedule in Indigo to run this script every minute.

#### FaceTimeCall.applescript
Legacy script I no longer use/maintain to initiate a FaceTime call.

#### AnswerFaceTime.applescript
Legacy script I no longer use/maintain to answer an incoming FaceTime call.
